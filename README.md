# My Personal Password Manager

this is project is inspired by kalle hallden's password manager that he created on his
youtube channel
i really wanted to make a program similar to what he did to store and access all my passwords inside my computer with the help of sqlite3 too  

# How does it work?

asks you for the master password
has the ability to generate you a new password if you want to
stores your pasword along with the username of that account
very straightforward and simple program that would definitely benefit me
who is kinda paranoid about his accounts lol


# Note
i hope someone would throw some advice for what i can improve in this program


# this is python
